Project Description/ Outline: 
•	
•	Note: Some locations were not shut down due to COVID, while others were. 
Research Questions to Answer:

3.	Is there a relationship between restaurant sales and uber sales?

Datasets to Be Used: 
•	Google Search Results API
•	Uber API data
Rough Breakdown of Tasks: 
•	View the datasets to determine the fields of interest
•	Start pandas and develop code to pull relevant data sets
•	Use Pandas to clean and format your data set(s)
•	Create a Jupyter Notebook describing the **data exploration and cleanup** process
•	Create a Jupyter Notebook illustrating the **final data analysis**
•	Use Matplotlib to create a total of 6-8 visualizations of your data (ideally, at least 2 per "question" you ask of your data)
•	Save PNG images of your visualizations to distribute to the class and instructional team, and for inclusion in your presentation
•	Optionally, use at least one API, if you can find an API with data pertinent to your primary research questions
•	Create a write-up summarizing your major findings. This should include a heading for each "question" you asked of your data, and under each heading, a short description of what you found and any relevant plots.
